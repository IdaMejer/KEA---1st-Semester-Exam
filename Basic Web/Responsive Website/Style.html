     <h1>CUBISM</h1> 
    <h4>
    The universe of cubism </h4>
    <p>
Cubism is an early-20th-century art movement which brought European painting and sculpture toward 20th century Modern art. Cubism in its various forms inspired related movements in literature and architecture. It has been considered to be among the most in uential art movements of the 20th century. The term is broadly used in association with a wide variety of art pro- duced in Paris (Montmartre, Montparnasse and Puteaux) during the 1910s and extending through the 1920s.
        In Cubist artwork, objects are analyzed, broken up and reassem- bled in an abstracted form—instead of depicting objects from a single viewpoint, the artist depicts the subject from a multitude of viewpoints to represent the subject in a greater context.</p>


    
    <p>INFLUENCES</p>
