        <h4>ABOUT ME</h4>
    <p>
         I am a 29 year old multimedia design student living in Copenhagen.
For several years I have lived abroad, so it was only natural to choose the international line at KEA.

I also work as a project manager for a translation company. Here I coordinate the translations with the client and the various translators.

My spare time is spent with my pet dog Stella, taking walks at Assistentens Cemetary.
I also like to work out, cook food and chill with a film.
